# About

I'm a full stack developer from Norway. I'm currently in my third and final year of my batchelor degree in computer science and are thinking of appling for a master in computer technology.

Started fiddeling with programming when I was 16 and have loved it every since. Besides developing, I enjoy some computer games and going to the gym to hang out with friends and work out.

More and more I find my self learning about knew technologies and the ability to solve problems in an afficient and elegant way.
