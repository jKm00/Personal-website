			'In my fourth semester of my batchelor I had two courses, web technologies and application development. Throughout the semester, next to the lectures, we had an on going project combining what we learned in both the subjects to create a website.',

			'The beginning was a lot of planning. Creating wireframes, sketching the design of the database, creating a design guideline etc. We had many team meatings a this point to share and discuss different opinions and options until we were satisfied.',
			'Spring boot was taught in the application coures, so this was the framework we desided to use for our API. As for the frontend, HTML, CSS and JavaScript was taught in the web technologies course, but our group desided to use React as our frontend framework as some members already had some experience with it. For our database we used PostgreSQL as again, member of the group had experience with it. At the very end of the project we also desided that we were to dockerize our app, to make it easier for production.',
			"Throughout the development github was actively used. Every meating, we discussed things that needed to be implemented and/or changed and filed it as github issues. With this, it was easy for a single member to pick an issue from the issue list, work with it on a new branch, and then merge it back into the main branch with a simple pull request. This also made it possible to add code review to our workflow. Both to make sure the implemented was ok, but also so members that didn't implement sertain features could understand it by looking through it when it was finished and approve it.",
			'This project was a great success. We reached all our goals and learned a lot along the process.'

So whenever I pushed some new code to the repository, it automatically get's build, tested and then published if every test are passed.",

I wanted something that I was genuenlly happy with and something that fit me as well as it was easy to understand and use. My first version looked OK+, but it had some flaws.
