The main purpose is to learn technologies relevant in real-life projects, build a developer's portfolio and have fun socialising with people of same interested.\r\n\r\nWe started with a meating discussing what technologies we where to use for the project and ended up with spring-boot for our backend API, react for our frontend, MySQL for database, apache kafka for message sharing and ngnix as a server proxy.\r\n\r\nSo far we have implemented a dashboard where the user should be able to see their watched coins with relevant information. Such as how much they have invested in each coin, the current price etc. We've also implemented login and signup pages for the frontend, but the authentication logic is still to be implemented.\r\n\r\nCome back for more updates ðŸ˜‰\r\n\r\n","published":false}
