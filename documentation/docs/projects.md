This is the project you are currently visiting. Wanted to try out and learn some new technologies as well as I needed a portfolio to get my name out there. Since this was a solo project I could select the exact technologies I was most interrested in and learned a lot along the way. Such as end-to-end testing, github actions and server-side vs client-side rendering. Had a tun of fun with this project.
